        <h2>Courses/Program</h2>
        <p>
            At Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) I am taking courses ranging
            from finance, to accounting, to computer science. A Business Technology Degree has allowed me 
            to explore my passion for business and entrepreneurship, while also allowing me to learn about
            the cutting-edge technologies of tomorrow.
        </p>

        <h3>Most Useful Course</h3>
        <p>
            Among all the courses, the one that stood out to me the most was "Advanced Web Development."
            This course equipped me with practical skills in building modern web applications using
            cutting-edge technologies. The hands-on projects and collaborative nature of the course
            significantly enhanced my problem-solving and teamwork abilities.

        <h2>Extra-Curricular Activities</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to academics, I actively participated in the university's coding club, where
            I organized coding competitions and workshops. This experience helped me foster leadership
            and organizational skills while contributing to the vibrant tech community on campus.
