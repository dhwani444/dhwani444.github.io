    <!--Font Resize Accessibility Feature:
    this feature allows folks with visual impairments to increase or decrease
    the size of text on my personal website, using the buttons provided. These change
    the font size of not only my website, but also components on my website such as forms.
    The font sizes increase consistently with their element tags. For example, text with 
    an h1 tag increases at a faster pace than text with an ol tag, as they vary in size.
    Lastly, the buttons for resizing font are located on the left side of my website, to ensure
    that folks with low vision are able to see the buttons, as quite commonly those with 
    low vision have trouble with seeing the right side of a screen.-->

        <h3>Most Useful Course</h3>
        <p>
            Among all the courses, the one that stood out to me the most was <strong>ITM 735: ICT and Diversity Management</strong>
            . Where most courses I am taking are very technical, this course allowed me to 
            learn about IT from another aspect- from a human aspect. I learned all about why diversity is
            criucial in the IT field, as it helps informs the technologies of tomorrow. <br><br> One example
            that particularly stood out to me was in the development of automatic hand soap dispensers. 
            The team that designed this was not diverse, so when the device was tested it was only tested
            on lighter-skinned subjects. This meant that when the machine was put into production, it only
            worked on those with lighter skin. <br><br> Along with many examples like the above. ITM 735 taught
            me that thinking about technology from a human point of view is equally if not more important 
            as the technical components of the product. Technology must be designed for all in order to 
            create a more sustainable and equitable industry.
