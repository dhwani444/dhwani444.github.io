        <h2>Courses/Program</h2>
        <p>
            At Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) I am taking courses ranging
            from finance, to accounting, to computer science. A Business Technology Degree has allowed me 
            to explore my passion for business and entrepreneurship, while also allowing me to learn about
            the cutting-edge technologies of tomorrow.
        </p>

        <h3>Most Useful Course</h3>
        <p>
            Among all the courses, the one that stood out to me the most was ITM 735: ICT and Diversity
            Management. Where most courses I am taking are very technical, this course allowed me to 
            learn about IT from another aspect- from a human aspect. I learned all about why diversity is
            criucial in the IT field, as it helps informs the technologies of tomorrow. <br><br> One example
            that particularly stood out to me was in the development of automatic hand soap dispensers. 
            The team that designed this was not diverse, so when the device was tested it was only tested
            on lighter-skinned subjects. This meant that when the machine was put into production, it only
            worked on those with lighter skin. <br><br> Along with many examples like the above. ITM 735 taught
            me that thinking about technology from a human point of view is equally if not more important 
            as the technical components of the product. Technology must be designed for all in order to 
            create a more sustainable and equitable industry.

        <h2>Extra-Curricular Activities</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to academics, I am an active student leader, and find myself particularly drawn to 
            extra-curricular activities focusing on technology, and closing the gender gap in the tech 
            industry. <br><br> The following are extra-curricular activities I partake in at TMU.
